<h3 class="archive__subtitle">Introduction</h3>
<p>Morocco has witnessed a new migration dynamic in recent years. Initially viewed as a transit country to Europe, Morocco has gradually become a final destination for people who are fleeing political strife and harsh economic conditions in their countries. Each year, thousands of migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere arrive to Morocco. Following the so-called Arab Spring, the political stability of the country has attracted migrants from countries such as Syria and Libya.  The current migration situation has brought questions of security, citizenship, and humanitarian assistance into the national dialogue. Immigration has become an important concern of policy makers and civil society actors.</p>

<p>Indeed, Morocco faces new social and legal challenges. In addition to factors that lead people to leave their home countries, stricter European immigration policies have stemmed the flow of people leaving Morocco after they arrive. Once here, people want to pursue studies or find a job. In addition to people seeking to improve their economic situations, there are asylum seekers and refugees who require different attention and support. The economic, legal, and social pressures created by recent immigration trends led the King to unveil a new immigration policy to better regulate immigrants in 2013.</p>


<p>New policy approaches demonstrate the Moroccan state's awareness of the importance of the immigration issue.  Nevertheless, the majority of adopted policies do not seem to produce the desired effects and immigration remains a major challenge. Integration of immigrants as well as granting citizenship rights are central to the debate on social inclusion. Integration implies taking measures that accommodate immigrants from different countries regardless of their social, ethnic or religious backgrounds. In order to be fully integrated into the society, immigrants have to be considered as citizens; therefore, immigration requires a more comprehensive approach and the development of public policies that integrate migrants from different backgrounds.</p>

<p>To shed more light on this important theme and in order to contribute to the debate on public policies related to this issue, the Moroccan Fulbright Alumni Association (MFAA) is organizing an international conference on the issue of integration of immigrants in Morocco. The 2016 MFAA general conference seeks to put emphasis on the shifting migration dynamics that Morocco has witnessed in recent years. It will provide a platform to discuss the integration of immigrants in Morocco as well as the role of citizenship in integrating immigrants. The papers accepted in this conference will reflect on the integration of immigrants in Morocco (employment, education, health, housing, culture etc.) and treat immigrantsâ€™ integration and citizenship from a comparative perspective. The papers will raise questions concerning complex economic and social developments in response to immigration and will articulate a vision for a better integration of migrants into Moroccan society.</p>

<p>The conference is open to students, professors, researchers, policy makers, civil society actors, professionals, and journalists. It will be held on Saturday, December 3rd in Rabat. Abstracts are welcome in the related fields, they should be sent no later than July 31st.</p>
